# ccc2016
my solutions for (some of) the 2016 senior CCC problems

Due to the absence of the online grading tool during the exam period, these solutions were not tested properly. Solution #1 and #2 work for all test cases. Soltion #3 is incomplete. Solution #4 and #5 aren't optimized and exceed the time limit on most cases.

I am not proud of these scores, but they reflect the amount of work I could produce under the 3 hour time limit without any ability to test my code against grading test cases.
